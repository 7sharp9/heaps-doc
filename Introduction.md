What follows is a brief introduction to Heaps that will get you up and running with a simple project.

The preferred editor for working in heaps is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). With Code, we can leverage extensions like the [Chrome Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug) to make debugging easy. This introduction assumes the use of Code for setting up a project, but it is still very possible to get Heaps up and running in your editor of choice.
