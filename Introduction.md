**Heaps** is a cross platform graphics engine designed for high performance games. It's designed to leverage modern GPUs that are commonly available on both desktop and mobile devices. The framework currently supports HTML5 WebGL, Flash Stage3D, native Mobile (iOS and Android) and Desktop with OpenGL.

The Heaps API is comprised of several top level packages, namely:

- h2d used for 2D display (for 2D games and user interfaces)
- h3d used for rendering 3D models
- hxd contains cross platform classes such as Bitmaps, and a complete resource loading and management framework
- hxsl is the Heaps Shader Language implementation
